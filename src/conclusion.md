## Conclusions

1. **Economic growth has widened global income gaps.**  
   High-income countries have pulled far ahead in GDP per capita, while low- and lower-middle-income countries show slower, uneven growth.

2. **Social outcomes improve with GDP, but not uniformly.**  
   Higher income strongly correlates with higher literacy, higher life expectancy, and lower poverty. Variation is greatest in low-income countries and smallest in high-income ones.

3. **Environmental outcomes do not improve reliably with economic growth.**  
   Renewable energy use is often higher in poorer countries due to structural dependence rather than sustainability policy. Wealthier nations emit more per capita despite having lower carbon intensity.

4. **Regions follow different development strategies.**  
   Some (e.g., Latin America) balance moderate GDP with sustainability; others prioritize GDP growth despite environmental costs. Development trajectories are not uniform.

5. **Education and well-being gaps are narrowing despite persistent income inequality.**  
   Developing regions have rapidly increased primary school completion and reduced poverty, showing convergence in basic welfare indicators even as GDP gaps persist.

## Limitations and Weaknesses
  
1. **GDP per capita is an incomplete and potentially misleading proxy for “development.”**
GDP ignores distribution of wealth, informal economies, inequality, and non-market goods such as unpaid labor or environmental degradation. Countries with the same GDP can differ radically in actual living standards, institutional quality, or social protections. Reliance on GDP risks overstating progress in contexts where gains accrue to narrow elites.

2. **Correlations cannot establish causation.**  
Scatterplots and trend lines show *associations* but cannot determine whether GDP drives improvements in health or education, or vice versa. Similarly, environmental trends cannot be interpreted as GDP “causing” emissions or renewable adoption. Policy environments, historical legacies, demographic dynamics, and natural resources confound simple causal interpretations.

3. **Environmental indicators are structurally biased.**  
Renewable energy shares and emissions are influenced by:  
- natural resource availability (hydropower, biomass, fossil fuels),  
- climate and geography,  
- legacy energy infrastructure,  
- industrial composition.  
Thus, comparing countries purely by GDP oversimplifies deeply path-dependent energy systems.

4. **Missing, inconsistent, or sparse data disproportionately affect low-income countries.**  
Data gaps can bias cluster formation, shrink or distort regional patterns, and overrepresent countries with more robust statistical systems. “Cleaner” data for high-income nations may artificially tighten observed relationships.

5. **K-means clustering imposes artificial structure.**  
K-means assumes spherical, evenly sized clusters that may not reflect real geopolitical, institutional, or demographic differences. Countries with similar GDP but wildly different histories may be grouped together, while meaningful outliers may be forced into arbitrary clusters.

6. **Regional averages obscure internal variation.**  
Aggregating values by region (e.g., for sustainability metrics) can mask large internal disparities — especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Regional trends risk being misinterpreted as representative when they may be dominated by a few large economies.

7. **Time-series differences complicate comparison across indicators.**  
Not all variables are available for the same years. Some indicators (such as emissions or education metrics) have large temporal gaps. This can produce misleading synchronicity in visualizations, where apparent patterns may simply reflect mismatched time coverage.

Economic growth reliably predicts improvements in social indicators but not environmental ones. Income inequality between nations has grown, yet gaps in health, education, and poverty have narrowed. Sustainability outcomes remain policy-driven rather than wealth-driven, and data limitations caution against overinterpreting visual patterns. Long-term development is multidimensional, uneven, and shaped as much by institutions and resources as by income itself.
